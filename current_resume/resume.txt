Paytm

Led ML and Gen AI initiatives across Central AI and Ads ML teams, designing scalable ML pipelines and mentoring a team of ~5 data scientists. Spearheaded end-to-end solutioning, development, deployment, and continuous optimization of ML pipelines and Gen AI solutions.

- Optimized the ML pipeline in the Ads ML team, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Upgraded the data pipeline by adding features and transitioned the algorithm from tree-based models to neural networks, driving an average ~20% increase in ad conversion rates across app properties
- Successfully delivered projects predicting customer click behavior and churn (used XGBoost and ANN), enhancing business decision-making.
- Established A/B testing pipeline and sustained model improvement, achieving a consistent lift of ~15%
- Built AI solutions, such as a natural language based BI tool enabling rapid decision-making for non-technical users, and voice-based solutions enhancing customer support efficiency. These solutions resulted in a 90% reduction in man-hours and a 60% decrease in employee costs
- Implemented cost-saving measures and optimized various processes using data engineering across multiple projects, resulting in a 90% reduction in compute resources
- Engaged in the decision-making and implementation of app modifications to enhance traffic and engagement across multiple businesses. Utilized data science and analytics (with A/B testing) to drive data-informed decisions

EXL

Developed and deployed machine learning solutions addressing attrition, retention, and cross-selling challenges, while managing end-to-end stakeholder engagement, including strategic leadership, delivery oversight, team development, and business relations. Led a multidisciplinary team of data scientists, analysts, data engineers, and project managers.

- Implemented a propensity model (using XGBoost) for call routing, identifying at-risk customers and directing them to specialized retention teams. This approach reduced call transfers and handle time while enhancing overall call ratings. Achieved lift of ~10%
- Migrated ML model scoring and training workflows to a custom AWS-based platform. Implemented ML pipeline for model retraining, evaluation, and scoring. This reduced infrastructure costs to 1/8th by eliminating licensing fees
- Oversaw team and revenue growth, business and relationship development, and client/stakeholder management. During my tenure, team size grew by approximately 20% and revenue increased by about 24%

Epsilon

Directed the full machine learning lifecycle, from stakeholder engagement to solution deployment and productionization. Oversaw and supported a team of developers and data scientists through mentoring and management.

- Designed and deployed multiple ML models (XGBoost and ANN) to develop recommendation engines for diverse clients, including hotel chains, retailers, and consumer finance institutions. Achieved notable campaign success, with ~300% revenue growth, 7% increase in open rates, and 21% improvement in click through rates
- Utilized advanced algorithms (ANN, NN embeddings, XGBoost) and champion-challenger approach to build ML pipelines, automating model refresh, enhancement, deployment, and performance monitoring
- Spearheaded internal initiatives, building code pipelines and adding features for streamlined modeling and analysis, saving team's time and enhancing capabilities
