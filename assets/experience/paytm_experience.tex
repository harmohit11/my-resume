Led ML and Gen AI initiatives across Central AI and Ads ML teams, designing scalable ML pipelines and mentoring a team of ~5 data scientists. Spearheaded end-to-end solutioning, development, deployment, and continuous optimization of ML pipelines and Gen AI solutions.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
    \item Optimized the ML pipeline in the Ads ML team, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Upgraded the data pipeline by adding features and transitioned the algorithm from tree-based models to neural networks, driving an average \textbf{~20\% increase in ad conversion rates} across app properties
    \item Successfully delivered projects predicting customer click behavior and churn (used XGBoost and ANN), enhancing business decision-making.
    \item Established A/B testing pipeline and sustained model improvement, achieving a consistent \textbf{lift of ~15\%}
    \item Built AI solutions, such as a natural language based BI tool enabling rapid decision-making for non-technical users, and voice-based solutions enhancing customer support efficiency. These solutions \textbf{resulted in a 90\% reduction in man-hours and a 60\% decrease in employee costs}
    \item Implemented cost-saving measures and optimized various processes using data engineering across multiple projects, resulting in a \textbf{90\% reduction} in compute resources
    \item Engaged in the decision-making and implementation of app modifications to \textbf{enhance traffic and engagement} across multiple businesses. Utilized data science and analytics (with A/B testing) to drive data-informed decisions
\end{itemize}
